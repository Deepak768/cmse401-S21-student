## Welcome to CMSE401: Methods in Parallel Programming


Hello CMSE401 students,

I am excited to be teaching CMSE401 this Spring and look forward to meeting all of you in class next week. Pleasee see the course website for all information about this course:

* [CMSE401 website](http://cmse.msu.edu/cmse401)

This semester is unique since, due to new university COVID policies, we will not be meeting the first week of class. Instead the first week will be used for reading, review and semester preparation.  To this end, I require that all students complete the pre-semester tasks found on the following website before showing up for the first day of class which will be on **_Wednesday January 20th_**.  NOTE: failure to complete these tasks will be reflected in your course participation grade. 

* [Class Preparation Checklist](Class_Prep_Checklist)

I will be holding office hours the first week of class. Please feel free to stop by to just introduce yourself or ask a question about the course or any of the following tasks.  Also, please do not hesitate to contact me at (colbrydi@msu.edu). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Dirk Colbry 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CMSE401 instructor
