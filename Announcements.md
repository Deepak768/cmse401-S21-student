## Welcome to CMSE401: Methods in Parallel Programming


Hello CMSE401 students,

I am excited to be teaching CMSE401 this Spring and look forward to meeting all of you in class this week. This semester is unique since, due to new university COVID policies, we will not be meeting the first week of class. Instead the first week will be used for reading, review and semester preparation.  To this end, I require that all students complete the following tasks before showing up for the first day of class which will be on **_Wednesday January 20th_**.  NOTE: failure to complete these tasks will be reflected in your course participation grade. 

I will be holding office hours the first week of class. Please feel free to stop by to just introduce yourself or ask a question about the course or any of the following tasks.  Also, please do not hesitate to contact me at (colbrydi@msu.edu). 

    Dr. Dirk Colbry 
    CMSE401 instructor

Detailed information about the course, including the syllabus, announcements, schedule and assignments can be found on the course website (Bookmark this page!):

- [CMSE401 Course Website](http://cmse.msu.edu/cmse401)

**_Task 1 - Syllabus and Course Review_**

To start, I suggest that you watch the following video and review the course Syllabus.

- [Welcome video]()

- [Course Syllabus](https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/cmse401-S21-student/Syllabus)


**_Task 2 - Student Background Review_**

Students in CMSE401 come from a variety of backgrounds.  To help the instructor adjust the curriculum and provide support to all students in this course please fill out the following on-line survey:

- []()


**_Task 3 - get Jupyter working_**

We will be using Jupyter notebooks for most of our student/instructor communication. Please attend class with the latest version of Anaconda Python installed on your computer (Anaconda includes Jupyter). Instructions for installing and using Anaconda and Jupyter can be found here:

- [0000--Jupyter-Getting-Started-Guide.html](https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/mth314-F20-student/assignments/0000--Jupyter-Getting-Started-Guide.html)

As a backup, all students are also given accounts on the MSU jupyterhub servers [http://jupyterhub.msu.edu](http://jupyterhub.msu.edu) and [http://jupyterhub2.msu.edu](http://jupyterhub2.msu.edu).  Make sure you follow the directions in the above "getting started guide" and ensure that you can login and use both jupyterhub servers. 

**_Task 4 - Review git and download the course git repository_**

In this class we assume that everyone knows how to use git. All course materials will be downloaded using the course git repository and class projects will be submitted to the instructor using git.  The instructor realizes that git is a fairly complex tool and has provided the following tutorial as a reference. 

- [Getting to know git (Tutorial)](https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/cmse802-f20-student/0000--Jupyter-Getting-Started-Guide.html)

Please review the above tutorial (especially the sections about consuming and producing git repositories) and download the course git repository to your laptop and/or the course jupyterhub server using the following command.

```git clone ```


**_Task 5 - Review bash and login to the HPCC_**

Parallel programming is all about making your code run faster. As members of the MSU community we all have access to a fairly large (~10,000 cores) supercomputer located at the High Performance Computing Center (HPCC) which is in the Institute for Cyber Enabled Research (ICER).  All of you should have been given accounts to the HPCC.  Please use use the following tutorials to learn about how supercomputers are made and check your accounts by logging into the HPCC using the OnDemand server:

- [https://ondemand.msu.edu](https://ondemand.msu.edu)

**_Task 6 - Pre-class assignment_**

You are expected to come to class ready to complete the in-class assignemnts.  To prepare for most classes, students are required to complete pre-class assignments (typically 2, pre-class assignments per week).  These assignments will be in the form of jupyter notebooks and will include reading, videos and programming activities.  The required time for each pre-class will vary but the instructor has tried to make them take approcimatly 30-minutes.  

Each pre-class assignment ends with an online survey which students are required to complete in order to earn credit for the assignment.  Your first weeks assignments are avaliable on the course git repository or downloadable from the course website.  At a minimum, you must complete the first pre-class assignment by 11:59pm on Tuesday January 19th.  

**_NOTE_**: A backup copy of this email is also provided as a reference on the course website in the [Annocements page](https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/cmse401-S21-student/Announcements).
