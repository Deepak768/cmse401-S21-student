# January 11, 2021 - Week 1 Assignment Correction/Clarification

Hello CMSE401 Students,

Sorry for the confusion but after sending out my previous email I learned that, per the new COVID policy, instructors are NOT allowed to assign any required work during the review week (January 11th-15th). I now understand that this policy must be in place because there are large groups of students that do not have access to reliable Internet this week.  To be fair and equitable to these students, the  [Class Preparation Checklist](https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/cmse401-S21-student/Class_Prep_Checklist) is no longer required and only recommended (I also got the link wrong in my previous email).  

Please email me if you have any comments, questions or concerns.  I am also happy to schedule a zoom or even a phone meeting if anyone would prefer to discuss the class and/or this policy.

Take care,

- Dirk

## Welcome to CMSE401: Methods in Parallel Programming


Hello CMSE401 students,

I am excited to be teaching CMSE401 this Spring and look forward to meeting all of you in class next week. Pleasee see the course website for all information about this course:

* [CMSE401 website](http://cmse.msu.edu/cmse401)

This semester is unique since, due to new university COVID policies, we will not be meeting the first week of class. Instead the first week will be used for reading, review and semester preparation.  To this end, I request that all students complete the pre-semester tasks found on the following website before showing up for the first day of class which will be on **_Wednesday January 20th_**.  

* [Class Preparation Checklist](https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/cmse401-S21-student/Class_Prep_Checklist)

I will be holding office hours the first week of class. Please feel free to stop by to just introduce yourself or ask a question about the course or any of the following tasks.  Also, please do not hesitate to contact me at (colbrydi@msu.edu).
