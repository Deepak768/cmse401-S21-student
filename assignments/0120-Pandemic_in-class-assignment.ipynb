The project will require you to learn about the software, get it installed and working on the HPC (or equivalent) and write up a short tutorial with examples with enough details so that your peers can get it up and running).  \n",
    "- **Milestone 3: Parallel Coding** - You will identify an existing scientific/engineering problem that currently runs slow on a single core.  You will either write a new program form scratch or modify an existing code to run in parallel.  You may also modify an existing parallel code to run in parallel faster.   You may, but are not required to use the software you explored in milestone 2 of the project. \n",
    "- **Milestone 4: Scaling Study** - You will conduct a scaling study of your Stage 3 project demonstrating speedup. \n",
    "- **Milestone 5: Video Presentation** - You will create a present the results of your scaling study to your peers in the form of an video presentation. \n",
    "- **Milestone 6: Final Report and example code** - You will turn in a git repository with your final report. Ideally this repository will include instructions sufficient for milestone 2 plus any code you used in stage 3 and 4.  \n"
